# File Signature Generator

This console application in C# generates a signature for a specified file. The signature is generated by dividing the original file into blocks of a given length (except for the last block). For each block, the SHA256 hash value is computed, and along with its number, it's displayed in the console.

# Task
It is required to write a console application in C# to generate a signature for a specified file. The signature is generated as follows: the original file is divided into blocks of a specified length (except for the last block), for each block, the value of the SHA256 hash function is computed, and together with its number, it is displayed in the console.

The program should be capable of handling files whose size exceeds the available memory and, at the same time, effectively utilize the computational power of a multi-core system. When working with threads, only standard classes and libraries from .Net are allowed (excluding ThreadPool, BackgroundWorker, TPL).

Implementation using Threads is expected. The path to the input file and the block size are specified in the command line. In case of an error during program execution, its text and StackTrace need to be displayed in the console.

## Usage

The path to the file is set through the command line. If an error occurs during the program's execution, its text and StackTrace will be displayed in the console.

## How to run

```csharp
// Example:
// Run the program from the command line with the file path as an argument:
// ```
// dotnet run <file_path>
// ```
// Replace <file_path> with the path of the file for which the signature needs to be generated.
// For example: dotnet run "D:\movies\Oldboy.avi"
```
